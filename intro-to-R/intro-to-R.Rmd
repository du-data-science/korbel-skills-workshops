# Required Software
Welcome to the first Korbel Skills Workshop^[All workshop materials are covered under a GPL 3.0 license. If you'd like more experience with the tools covered here, consult the instructors.]. These materials are available online at the following url:  

> https://du-data-science.github.io/korbel-skills-workshops/ (http://bit.ly/2hI2bYk)

You will need to install the following software for this workshop. Please install both (in order) in the next several minutes as we begin with a brief introduction of Data Science and the R statistical programming language.^[If you would like to setup your computer for future workshops, consider installing a TeX Distribution, either [MiKTeX for Windows](https://miktex.org/download) or [MacTeX for Mac](https://www.tug.org/mactex/). If you're on a Linux, some distributions include [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html) but you should make sure to update. You can also install [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for version control and create an account on [github](https://github.com/join). If you use your du.edu email address, you'll qualify for a free student account.]

## What is Data Science?

Beyond its status as a buzzword^[See [Davenport and Patil (2012)](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)], data science is simply a combination of a number of quantitatively-oriented skills, including statistics, mathematics, and computer science. There are many other terms and specific skills, but these are the core.  

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Data_Science_storytelling.jpg/522px-Data_Science_storytelling.jpg)

I would add that on top of the computer/quantitative skills, you will also have to learn how to write about and discuss data science techniques if you plan on using them in your career. Even for those of you that do not plan on persuing research, you will find yourself in a professional setting where you will have to engage with data. Why learn these data science skills? They should complement your knowledge about the content (domain expertise) and rhetorical skills _to help make you heard_.  

These workshops will only serve as an introduction to these tools, primarily the software. If you want more training in these skills, know that it will require work. We will discuss more advanced uses of these tools and additional training at the end of the workshop.  

## Why `R`?  

![](http://www.xqinformatics.com/xq/images/logo/logo%20r%20small.png)

`R` is a computer programming language. It is open-source, popular, and strikes a balance between having more flexibility than many other software packages (e.g. Stata, SPSS) and being a little easier to use (e.g. Python, SAS, S). If you encounter data science in your careers, it will probably be in `R`.^[Also note that because R is open-source, it is free. A commercial license for SPSS can run [as high as $8,000](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics/pricing) with similarly high costs for [Stata as well](https://www.stata.com/order/new/gov/volume-licenses/dl/)]  

Consider the example of the 2012 Presidential Campaign.^[See (https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/19/obama-campaigns-chief-data-guy-gets-candid-about-the-data-strategy-that-won-the-election/) and (https://www.technologyreview.com/s/508836/how-obama-used-big-data-to-rally-voters-part-1/) for more details.] The Obama campaign used data scientists, to collect data and create statistical models to help register voters and craft outreach. [Rayid Ghani](http://www.rayidghani.com/), a fellow at the University of Chicago and the Chief Scientist for the 2012 Obama for America campaign, led the effort. One of skills that they sought? R.

<br>

Will `R` always be around? Probably not. But it will prepare you to learn new languages as well. If you go further with data science, you will probably have to learn some other software. This is a mindset as much as it is formal training.

# Exploring RStudio
RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that makes R a lot easier to use. There is a lot of functionality built into RStudio, including dynamic documents, version control, and linkages to cloud-based resources. We won't cover those today. For now, open up RStudio to make sure that the install worked.    

## The Interface 
You should see something that looks like the image below:  

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4d/Rstudio.png)

By default there is space for four panels, though the top-left panel may be closed the first time that you open RStudio.^[This is similar to Stata's layout.] Don't worry. We'll cover that in a moment.  

### Console
The first place that you should look is the console. This is where you enter code and commands into R for your computer to process. In the old days, we'd have to open up a terminal/command prompt.  

Try to enter the following code into the __Console__ panel to make sure that RStudio can correctly locate `R`.  

```{r, eval = F}
print("hello world")
```

### Environment
In the top-right corner is a panel that has multiple tabs. Select the __Environment__ tab if it isn't already selected. Note that it should currently say "Environment is empty."  

One of the virtures of R is that it can load several objects into memory. Other software (Stata in particular) only loads one. While this helps keep the enviroment clear, it makes data management pretty difficult. Let's make a few objects in R and save them. Make sure to pay attention to the __Environment__ tab to see how it changes with the following commands. Type or copy/paste the following lines into the __Console__.  

```{r}
# This is a comment. 
# Any line in R that begins with a "#" will not execute. For example: 
# print("hello")
# Use comments to document code. I will use it provide a few notes. From here on out, don't worry about the commented lines.  

# To assign a value, use the "<-". You can also use an "=" but that is typically reserved. We'll see why later.  
# Don't worry. You can lie about this. 
yourAge <- 28
favoriteColor <- "blue"
x = 1
y = 3
```

What happened to the environment? You can now call any of the variables that you just created by referring to the by name. 

```{r, eval = F}
x
y
x+y
```
Note that R is case sensitive. Typing the following will give you an error.  

```{r, eval = F}
yourage
favoritecolor
```

You also can't save a variable with a space in the name -- at least you shouldn't.  

```{r, eval = F}
# This won't work
your age <- 28
```

### File Explorer
In the bottom-right, you'll see the __Files__ panel. You can access files here -- if it is a file that R can load as a dataset, then you'll also get a prompt with options. You could easily never touch the __Files__ panel, instead using the __Console__ or options within the "File -> " menu to access things, but it can be useful. There are usually three or four ways to do something in 'R'. Do what works for you.  

### Scripts, Markdown, Datasets
The final panel contains txt files that you can edit and will also display datasets. Most often, this space will have either a `.R` (script) or `.Rmd` (RMarkdown) file where you can save your commands. Similar to a Stata `.do` file, this allows you to keep a record of everything you've done in case you have to redo something. Unlike the console output, you can easily save these files. The console output will get cleared from time to time. We won't create a script or markdown file today, but they are useful.  

## Installing and Requiring Packages
One of the best aspects of `R` is that people continue to develop additional features and expand the functionality. Any user can download and attach these software packages to their own installation of `R`. Since this is all open-source, there aren't any warranties or support, so the challenge with these packages is keeping them up-to-date and reading through some rather obtuse documentation.  

We're going to install a few packages right now that will allow us to load data in many file formats into 'R'.  

```{r, eval = F}
# During the installation process, R may ask you to create a personal library or restart R. This should be fine. 
# You can install one package at a time
install.packages("haven")

# Or multiple
install.packages("readxl", "foreign")
```

With these packages installed, you can now use commands that are not part of "base `R`."
