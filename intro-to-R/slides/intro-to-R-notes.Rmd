# Introduction

## Welcome
![](https://www.bramblewoodpac.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/welcome-sign.jpg)
\note[item]{Who am I? PhD D from UIUC. Study civil conflict and democratization, but many interests -- mostly data-driven. I mostly do academic research, but also worked for Army Corps of Engineers and with many people who do policy work.}

\note[item]{Why 'Defense Security Methods?' You're in this series of methods courses to prepare you to do that too. You're here in this class because it will help you get a job! By the end of the course, you'll be able to ask good questions and have a plan to answer these questions. The next course in the sequence will introduce you to more, but don't underestimate the usefulness of just understanding the research process.}
