Use the html comment codes for hidden messages and notes. This will still appear in source. Note that LaTeX math mode, (i.e. $x$) doesn't always work in html. Be careful.  

To add: 
- Packrat integration
- Custom .css with Korbel/University of Denver colors and images
- Authorship and license within each file? 
- Figure out another name for "facilitators." Essentially a support/TA role within the workshop.

knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = T, # Things run faster... the second time. Reset if changes do not compile
                      include = T, eval = T, echo = T, # By default, code chunks are invisible but still execute 
                      message = F, warning = F, # If it's broke, we don't want to see it
                      dev = 'png', fig.path = "images/") # Save images in a specific directory

## Packages. Add packrat features here
